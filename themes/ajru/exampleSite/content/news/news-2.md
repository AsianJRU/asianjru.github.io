The Asian Jump Rope Union (AJRU), after much deliberation, has decided to host an online Virtual World Championships in 2021. This will replace the in-person tournament originally scheduled for July 2021 in Ottawa, Canada. The Virtual World Championship Series will include the:  

* Virtual World Championship  

* Virtual Junior World Championship  

* Virtual Asian Open Tournament  

Due to health and safety concerns, as well as global travel uncertainty, we’ve decided a virtual event is the best way to move forward for 2021. Review the updated AJRU rules for a virtual tournament. We look forward to seeing all of the amazing submissions from our athletes and hope that we can all meet in person again soon.
