<h3 id="janice-harrington-physical-education-teacher">JANICE HARRINGTON, PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHER</h3>
<p>Janice Harrington has taught elementary physical education for forty-seven years. Twenty-one years in Northern Virginia and twenty-six years in Torrington, Connecticut. She received her Bachelor of Science Degree in Health and physical Education from D.C. Teacher’s College, which is now known as the University of the District of Columbia. She received her Master’s Degree in Supervision from George Mason University.</p>
<p>Her passion for her field is reflected by the successes of her students, the depth of her program and her numerous awards and recognitions. Her program was first recognized for excellence when she taught in Virginia in 1988. After moving to Connecticut her program was recognized again by the Connecticut Association of Schools in 1995. She received two awards in 1997, one from the Iota Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. as a recipient of their Apple for the Teacher award. The second award was the annual Teacher of the Year Award from the Torrington Board of Education. She has supported the programs developed by the American Heart Association, known as Jump Rope for Heart and the Kids Heart Challenge, from the beginning of her teaching experience. She has also appeared in “Who’s Who Among America’s Teachers” in 1994, 2002, 2004-2005 and 2005-2006.</p>
<p>Janice also coaches a jump rope team with athletes ranging from grade 4 to adult. I have been teaching for forty-seven years and coaching jump rope for thirty-eight years. Growing up, my inspiration came from my physical education teachers that exposed me to everything but jump rope. The jump rope I learned was street Double Dutch. That means I took my Mom’s clothes line to make the ropes and we would jump during recess or at home, making up our own rhymes and we counted by tens.</p>
<p>I went to a physical education professional development day where they had a jump rope team, doing a demonstration and teaching the teachers. That was my first exposure to a “Jump Rope Team”. They did it all, single rope, long rope, Double Dutch, they jumped to music and they jumped on pogo sticks and pogo balls.From that point on, Janice has been involved as a jump rope coach with her team competing at American Double Dutch League (ADDL) and USA Jump Rope tournaments.</p>

<h3 id="keo-mokolopo-president---africa-jump-rope-federation">KEO MOKOLOPO, PRESIDENT - AFRICA JUMP ROPE FEDERATION</h3>
<p>Born and bred in Thaba- Nchu, South Africa, Keo currently an ambassador for the South African Gymnastics Federation and President of Africa Jump Rope Federation (AJRF). She is also on the IJRU Board of Directors representing Africa.</p>
<p>Even though Rope Skipping I started very late in my life (20’s) I have grown to love it and become a 4X World medalist. My passion however is in development (Athletes and Technical, we need both) especially in Africa, my motherland. My dream as the President of AJRF is to see as many African Countries as possible getting recognized by their highest sporting bodies nationally, only then I will know we are doing something right.</p>
<p>With Recognition comes support in all form and funding might also be possible as it is one of our biggest challenges in Africa. This will indeed aid in attendance of World Events as it is the only way we can learn, keep up with Jumping trends and of course make our African mark #ItIsPossible</p>
